# Evolution2 Notes

## Changes in Direction
- Adopted backend-only orchestration with a post-critique synthesis step to finalize the written resume section.
- Emphasized creativity over speed/cost: CAR structure, domain vocabulary, seniority consistency.
- Deferred exemplar mining to a later evolution phase; focus on prompt and synthesis quality now.

## New Ideas
- Role-play micro-prompts for targeted review before synthesis (e.g., Hiring Manager for target domain).
- Skill adjacency enrichment to suggest adjacent competencies for stronger framing.
- Optional style presets (conservative, results-heavy, product-oriented) for voice control without changing contracts.

## Next Actions
- Add unit/integration tests for synthesis and gap propagation.
- Record synthesis stage metrics and verify presence of gap bridging statements in final text.
