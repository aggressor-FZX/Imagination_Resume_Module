     deployment workflows, improving team efficiency by 30%

2. Claude 3 Haiku (ALTERNATIVE - $0.000719 per analysis)
   File: resume_Claude_3_Haiku_1768798184.md
   - Cost: $0.72 per 1,000 analyses (1.8x more expensive)
   - Speed: 2.92s (5.8x faster)
   - Quality: 95% quantification score
   - Tokens: 961 in / 383 out
   
   Sample Bullets:
   • Led development of an 87% accurate churn prediction model, saving the company 
     $2M annually in customer retention
   • Designed and implemented a real-time analytics dashboard using Tableau and Python, 
     which was adopted by the C-suite executives
   • Spearheaded the implementation of an A/B testing framework that increased conversion 
     rates by 12%
   • Automated ETL pipelines, reducing manual reporting time by 20 hours per week and 
     improving operational efficiency

3. Xiaomi MiMo v2 Flash (NOT RECOMMENDED - $0.184900 per analysis)
   File: resume_Xiaomi_MiMo_v2_Flash_1768798195.md

🧪 REUSABLE TEST SCRIPT
================================================================================
File: realistic_drafter_test.py
- Simulates real pipeline conditions
- Uses actual Hermes/FastSVM outputs
- Tests with real resume/job ad data
- Saves all outputs automatically
- Can be re-run anytime for regression testing

Usage:
  export OPENROUTER_API_KEY_1=your_key
  python realistic_drafter_test.py

================================================================================
🎯 QUICK DECISION MATRIX
================================================================================

For PRODUCTION (Backend Processing):
  → Use: DeepSeek v3.2
  → Cost: $0.40 per 1,000 analyses
  → Quality: 95%
  → Speed: 16.92s (acceptable for backend)

For REAL-TIME (User-Facing Features):
  → Use: Claude 3 Haiku
  → Cost: $0.72 per 1,000 analyses (only 80% more)
  → Quality: 95%
  → Speed: 2.92s (instant feedback)

For PREMIUM TIER (If needed):
  → Use: Claude 3 Haiku (not Xiaomi - too expensive)

================================================================================
💰 ANNUAL COST IMPACT (10,000 analyses/month)
================================================================================
DeepSeek v3.2:    $48/year
Claude 3 Haiku:   $86.40/year
Xiaomi MiMo v2:   $22,188/year

Savings with DeepSeek: $22,140/year vs Xiaomi

================================================================================
✅ NEXT STEPS
================================================================================
1. Review DRAFTER_MODEL_SELECTION_ANALYSIS.md
2. Compare the three resume outputs (resume_*.md files)
3. Approve DeepSeek v3.2 as primary model
4. Update pipeline_config.py:
   OR_SLUG_DRAFTER = "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2"
5. Deploy to production
